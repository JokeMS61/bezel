Install

I'm using the Pycharm IDE for development. So, install pycharm local.
The Community Edition is free for use in non commercial environments.
After installing Pycham, install Python, numpy and pygame from the
pycham ide under "File/New project setup/Settings for new Projects.

Edit under "Run/Edit Configurations/
set the main.py under ./server as executable.
